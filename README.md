# Project 1: ACE Score and Diabetes, BRFSS 2020, SAS
This is a research project using SAS in which I evaluated the relationship between continuous Adverse Childhood Experiences score and Diabetes.
* Data was taken from a simple random sample of 100,000 respondents to the 2020 BRFSS Survey.
* I ran correlations, simple logistic regressions, and multiple logistic regressions to assess the exposure-outcome relationship, confounding by Sex and Race/Ethnicity, and effect modification by Smoking.
